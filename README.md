# latest_workout

Very quick and dirty Python script that, given a full Apple Health export
zip file, will pull out the latest `gpx` route. Handy for then uploading to
somewhere like Strava.

# Why?

Normally I record walks and runs with a Fitbit, and it then syncs to Strava
without me having to bother. On occasion though either I screw up starting
the recording, or the GPS barfs. This little tool makes it easier for me to
pull the data out of the Apple Watch as a backup (yes, I do tend to record
with both DON'T JUDGE ME!).
